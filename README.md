An intelligent, IoT-enabled impact monitoring system designed to detect high-G head impacts in real-time. By combining linear acceleration (ADXL375) and angular velocity (MPU6050), the system calculates the **Combined Probability** of a concussion and alerts staff via a localized web dashboard and onboard visual indicators.

## System Overview 

The Impact Monitor functions as a standalone **Wi-Fi Access Point**. It samples sensor data at high frequencies (~800Hz) to ensure that sub-millisecond impact peaks are captured accurately.

* **Primary Sensor:** ADXL375 (±200g range) for Peak Linear Acceleration (PLA).
* **Secondary Sensor:** MPU6050 for Peak Rotational Acceleration (PRA).
* **Processing:** ESP8266 (D1 Mini) calculates risk thresholds locally.
* **Interface:** Mobile-responsive Web Dashboard accessible via any smartphone browser.

## 🧪 The Physics: Concussion Math

The system doesn't just measure "how hard" a hit was; it measures **risk**.

### 1. Linear Acceleration (PLA)

Measured in , extracted from the ADXL375. We subtract gravity () from the total magnitude to find the "Impact G".

### 2. Rotational Acceleration (PRA)

Calculated by taking the derivative of the Gyroscope data from the MPU6050 over time ():


### 3. Combined Probability (CP)

The code utilizes a probability function that combines PLA and PRA to determine the likelihood of a concussive event.

* **Low Risk:** PLA < 10g or CP < 0.20
* **Medium Risk:** CP ≥ 0.20 (⚠️ Yellow Warning)
* **High Risk:** CP ≥ 0.50 (🚨 Red Warning)

## 🧠 Global State Management

The code uses structured global states to keep the memory footprint organized:

* **`device` struct:** Stores current real-time sensor data (ax, ay, az, temp) and the system log string. This is what the Web Dashboard reads every second.
* **`event` struct:** Handles the "Impact Window." When a hit is detected, the system enters an "Active" state for 80ms to capture the absolute highest peaks before reporting.

---

## 💻 Web Dashboard

The built-in webserver provides a real-time interface:

* **Live Telemetry:** View current X, Y, Z forces and internal temperature.
* **System Log:** A scrolling terminal window showing impact reports and safety warnings.
* **LED Override:** A manual button to test the physical onboard LED.

## ⚠️ Safety Disclaimer

This device is a **prototype** and is intended for research and educational purposes only. It is **not** a certified medical device.

* A "Low Risk" reading does not guarantee the absence of a concussion.
* A "High Risk" reading should be followed by a professional medical evaluation immediately.
* Always follow official sports safety protocols (e.g., SCAT5).
